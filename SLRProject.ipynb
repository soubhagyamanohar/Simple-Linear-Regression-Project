        "i.\tLinear relationship\n",
        "ii.\tMultivariate normality\n",
        "iii.\tNo or little multicollinearity\n",
        "iv.\tNo auto-correlation\n",
        "v.\tHomoscedasticity\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### i.\tLinear relationship\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between response and feature variables should be linear. This linear relationship assumption can be tested by plotting a scatter-plot between response and feature variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### ii.\tMultivariate normality\n",
        "\n",
        "The linear regression model requires all variables to be multivariate normal. A multivariate normal distribution means a vector in multiple normally distributed variables, where any linear combination of the variables is also normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### iii.\tNo or little multicollinearity\n",
        "\n",
        "It is assumed that there is little or no multicollinearity in the data. Multicollinearity occurs when the features (or independent variables) are highly correlated.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### iv.\tNo auto-correlation\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, it is assumed that there is little or no auto-correlation in the data. Autocorrelation occurs when the residual errors are not independent from each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### v.\tHomoscedasticity\n",
        "\n",
        "Homoscedasticity describes a situation in which the error term (that is, the noise in the model) is the same across all values of the independent variables. It means the residuals are same across the regression line. It can be checked by looking at scatter plot.\n"
